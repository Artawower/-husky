#+TITLE: Contribution Guide

* Contribution GuideWelcome to the project! We appreciate your interest in contributing. This guide will help you get started.
** Programming Principles
We adhere to the following principles to ensure code quality and maintainability. These principles are crucial because I primarily work alone on this project, and they help me efficiently support new features while minimizing technical debt:
- Follow the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID][SOLID principles]].
- Practice [[https://martinfowler.com/bliki/Yagni.html][YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)]] by not adding unnecessary functionality.
- Keep designs simple by adhering to the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle][KISS principle]].
- Avoid code repetition with the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself][DRY principle]].
- Write code that is clean and maintainable, as outlined in the [[https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/clean-code/9780136083238/][Clean Code book]].
These principles ensure the codebase remains manageable, reducing the time and effort needed to maintain and extend the project.

** Code Style
- Use a linter to maintain code consistency. For Emacs packages, you can use `checkdoc` and `flycheck`.
- Ensure all your code is properly documented following Emacs Lisp conventions. 
- [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Documentation-Tips.html][Checkdoc Documentation]]

* Testing
- All new features and bug fixes should be accompanied by tests.
- Write unit tests using the `ert` framework.
- [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/ert/index.html][ERT Documentation]]

** Submitting Contributions
- Fork the repository and create a new branch for your feature or bugfix.
- Write clear, concise commit messages.
- Submit a pull request with a description of your changes.

** Linting and Documentation Checks
- Run `checkdoc` to ensure your documentation follows Emacs Lisp standards.
- Use `flycheck` to catch syntax errors and warnings.
